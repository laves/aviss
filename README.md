=====

AVISS (Audio Visualized on Interactive Shapes and Surfaces) was a capstone research project worked on by Ian Lavery for his Minor in Music Technology at the University of British Columbia. 

The goal of AVISS was to take full spectrum data of audio in and alter visuals using the power detected in each frequency bin. This method of audio visualization is a deeper and more accurate one that combines a scientific sound analysis (FFT) visualization combined with the artistic drawing possibilities granted through the Processing programming environment. These shapes can then be minipulated via OSC and the Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor.
